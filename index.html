        <h2>A Bit About Myself</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Sally and I'm a returning student. I currently work in the
            medical field. I'm looking to change career paths. I'm very passionate about web design, learning animation and learn more about art.
            So I returned to school to obtain my A.A degree and see where this course
            takes me. I started to draw more and creating short stories, my goal is to publish some web comics, or make stories and make this into a hobbie.
            I want to enjoy what I do and I know I am not very talented but I want to try and have fun in the process.
