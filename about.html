        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a middle age woman who is eager to learn animation and create short stories animation. 
            I grew up in a religious enviroment, and have a big family. I'm the third oldest out of six.
            My interest in animation came when I was in high school, my friends introduce me into the world of Japanese
            animation and I was instantly hooked. Ever since my first "manga" book, I collect books and watch animation by myself,
            because my other siblings and parents did not like it. 
            <br />

        <p>
            Because of my families values, I felt I had to choose a career path was not my what I wanted to pursue. However, I still manage to 
            break out and watch anime and enjoy what I can. Ten plus years later, I am at a dead end, and in a pandemic I decided to follow my 
            passion. I know I wont accoplish much and I have my doubts. I get jealous of seeing many talented young adults on social medias creating
            their art work. But I use that energy to inspire myself to keep going and keep practicing art and write down my ideas.
